# mikehansford.id.au on Sveltekit
## Why?
I'm using my website as a project for learning Sveltekit.

## Setup
You need an .env file with the following content:

```
API_URL="[URL to the Headless CMS API]"
API_USERNAME="[user to use to get a JWT]"
API_PASSWORD="[user's password]"
VITE_JWT_STORAGE_KEY="[sessionstorage key to use for the JWT]"
```
